                        <h2>Hi, My name is Jorge.</h2>
               <p>I am 30 years old. I have lived in California my entire life. I've always had a passion for technology and computers. I have a long resume and history of working in IT and tech in general.</p>
               <p>I started attending Chaffey back in 2010 but dropped out with 1 year left on my degree after I received a job offer to work in IT. The job had long hours and random scheduling so I could not go to school and work at the same time.</p>
	       <p>I was only at that job for 2 years before I landed another job building websites mainly with Wordpress and HTML. For the past 3 years, I have been employeed with the City of Ontario and IT Specialist.</p>
	       <p>I have been out of school for more than 8 years now and my goal now is to receive my Associates Degree in Computer Infomration Systems with an emphasis in programing this coming May, 2021.</p>
   	     <h3>IT'S NEVER TOO LATE TO FINISH</h3>
