           <p><span class="studio">How to use the Internet Safley</span> The internet has revolutionised the way we live our lives â€“ enabling us to read the news, enjoy entertainment, carry out research, book our holidays, buy and sell, shop, network, learn, bank and carry out many other everyday tasks.<br>
<br>
Even though apps loom larger in most people's daily online interactions than traditional websites do, that does not mean that the basic Internet safety rules have changed. Hackers are still on the lookout for personal information they can use to access your credit card and bank information..<br>
<br>
Almost every major website you visit tracks your online activity.  Tracking technology can follow you from site to site, track and compile your activity, and compile all of this into a database.  Generally, tracking utilizes a numerical identifier, rather than your real name.  This information is used to personalize the content that you see online.<br>
